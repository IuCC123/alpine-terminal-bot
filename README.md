# alpine-terminal-bot
**Currently Linux only, you can always modify the code to make it work with Windows.**
Run Alpine Linux commands using a minecraft-protocol bot that communicates with an Alpine Linux docker image

## Usage
- Make sure you have docker installed on your system. (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)
- Pull the Alpine Linux docker image by doing `docker pull alpine` (https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine)
- Run `node .` and wait until the bot's core has been setup, then do `,rebuild`, after that do `,run <command>` and the bot should reply with the output given.

Feel free to use/modify this bot however you want, you can always help me out by making pull requests, good luck!
